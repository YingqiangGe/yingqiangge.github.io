## About Me
Welcome!

Currently, I'm a PhD student in Computer Science Department at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ](https://www.rutgers.edu/). And I am fortunate enough to have [Prof. Yongfeng Zhang](http://yongfeng.me/) as my supervisor. Before that, I received M.S. degree from Rutgers University in 2019 and B.S. degree from Zhengzhou University in 2017.

My research interests lie in the interface of Machine Learning and Information Retrieval with specific focus on: Recommender System, Economic Recommendation, Explainable Recommendation, Fairness-aware Recommendation and Causal Recommendation.
